This project is a spin off of DataQuest's Premier League Predictions YouTube series.

Changes from original:
- Scraping: The original code was built in an older version of Python, so deprecated functions were changed to fit Python 3.11
- RandomForestClassifer: The general structure of the data cleaning is the same. However, to increase the complexity of model, I used hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model even further.

Expected Expansions:
- Use a different model
- Choose different parameters
